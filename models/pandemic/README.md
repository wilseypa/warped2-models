## Introduction :

This simulation model simulates the coronavirus outbreak. A new parallel
discrete event formulation of the reaction-diffusion model was developed.
It is motivated by the one reported in [2]. The epidemic is modeled using
a combination of reaction  and diffusion  processes. The reaction  is
defined as  a result of  inter-entity  interactions, (e.g. influenza or
physical proximity). The mobility of the entities leads to the  dynamic
chances for interactions (e.g., watching movie in a cinema and  other
co-located  activities). Geographical diffusion  of entities provides
chances for  interactions  among  different  sample  sets  of entities.

This model contains four parts [1]:

+ A set of interacting entities.

+ A network graph that shows the interaction structure of entities.
  Currently 'WattsStrogatz' [3] and 'BarabasiAlbert' [4] graphs are 
  supported.

+ A reaction process, called within-host progression, which models the
  progress of the disease in an individual entity.

+ A diffusion process, called between-host transmission, which models
  the transmission of the disease among individual entities.

## Heatmaps :

The epidemic model prints out two separate heatmaps:

+ Population Size Change at locations : If population of a location
  decreases during simulation, it is colored GREEN; if population
  increases, it is colored RED; otherwise it is colored BLACK. Dark
  areas represent areas with less change in population size after
  the simulation. Filename is 'population\_diffusion\_hmap.ppm'.

+ Affected Count Change at locations : If number of affected people
  decreases at a location during simulation, it is colored GREEN; if
  number increases, it is colored RED; otherwise it is colored BLACK.
  Dark areas represent areas with less change in number of infected
  people after the simulation. Filename is 'disease\_growth\_hmap.ppm'.
